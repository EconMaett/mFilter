# mFilter: Miscellaneous Time Series Filters

The mFilter package by [Mehmet Balcilar](https://mbalcilar.github.io/) implements several time series filters useful for smoothing and extracting trend and cyclical components of a time series. 

The routines are commonly used in economics and finance, however they should also be interest to other areas. 

Currently implemented time series filters are:
- Christiano-Fitzgerald
- Baxter-King
- Hodrick-Prescott
- Butterworth
- trigonometric regression filters

The R package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mFilter) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mbalcilar/mFilter).
